1. Two Sum
Easy
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Example 1:
    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:
    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]
Example 3:
    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]

7. Reverse Integer
Easy
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
Example 1:
    Input: x = 123
    Output: 321
Example 2:
    Input: x = -123
    Output: -321
Example 3:
    Input: x = 120
    Output: 21
Example 4:
    Input: x = 0
    Output: 0

9. Palindrome Number
Easy
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.
Example 1:
    Input: x = 121
    Output: true
Example 2:
    Input: x = -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:
    Input: x = 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 4:
    Input: x = -101
    Output: false

13. Roman to Integer
Easy
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
Example 1:
    Input: s = "III"
    Output: 3
Example 2:
    Input: s = "IV"
    Output: 4
Example 3:
    Input: s = "IX"
    Output: 9
Example 4:
    Input: s = "LVIII"
    Output: 58
    Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 5:
    Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
    Output: 1994
    Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

14. Longest Common Prefix
Easy
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
Example 1:
    Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
    Output: "fl"
Example 2:
    Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
    Output: ""
    Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
